# JavaFX Customer Management System
This project is a calendar / appointment scheduler application.

Focus of the project is to create a UI in JavaFX, connect to and retrieve / edit information in a database, and use advanced java controls and features.

The project was created as a way to test multiple areas of focus:
- Create an application with CRUD capabilities, sufficient for the storing of data on an externally hosted database
- Ensure that the application was modeled with DAO principles (controller classes and methods for service calls outside of the front end implementation)
- That the application has the capability to validate and authenticate a user for login
- Ensure that at least the login page, could be displayed in multiple languages (in this instance English and Spanish)
- The program would log all user interactions with the login page, and had proper messaging and error controls for logins
- The application was built with a fully functioning GUI, and data retrieved from the database could be displayed and queried properly via user interaction
